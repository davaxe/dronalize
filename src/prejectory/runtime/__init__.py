"""Execution-first runtime API.

The public runtime surface is organized around four steps:

- build an [`ExecutionRequest`][prejectory.runtime.ExecutionRequest]
- resolve it into an [`ExecutionPlan`][prejectory.runtime.ExecutionPlan]
- execute the request directly with [`execute_request`][prejectory.runtime.execute_request]
- or execute a resolved plan with [`execute_plan`][prejectory.runtime.execute_plan]
